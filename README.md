# Rape Detection using AI

## Overview
This project aims to develop an AI-based system capable of detecting rape and non-consensual acts in videos using deep learning and computer vision techniques. The system differentiates between consensual and non-consensual activities based on various visual and contextual cues.

## Status
This project is currently a work in progress. Due to ethical and legal considerations, the dataset cannot be uploaded publicly as it contains explicit content (+18) involving consensual and non-consensual acts.

I have added a model file, training code, and a `.keras` model file, but I haven't uploaded them due to inaccurate outputs. I am still experimenting with different approaches to improve the results.

## Features
- **Deep Learning-Based Detection**: Uses AI models trained on video data to classify acts as consensual or non-consensual.
- **Computer Vision Techniques**: Implements various image and video processing techniques to improve accuracy.
- **Real-Time Processing (Planned)**: Future enhancements may include real-time detection capabilities.

## Dataset
The dataset used in this project is not publicly available due to age-related concerns and ethical considerations. However, researchers and collaborators may reach out for discussions regarding potential dataset alternatives.

## Technologies Used
- **Python**
- **Deep Learning (TensorFlow/PyTorch)**
- **OpenCV**
- **Machine Learning Algorithms**

## Installation & Usage
Since the project is under development, installation instructions will be provided once a stable version is available.
